# Aviation Risk Assessment
## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive risk assessment framework to analyze and evaluate risk factors associated with different aircraft models, weather conditions, and phases of flight. The primary objective is to identify aircraft with lower risk profiles, analyze incident trends over time, and assess how external factors like weather and aircraft specifications contribute to these incidents. The dataset includes details on aviation occurrences, such as fatalities, serious injuries, and aircraft characteristics

## Business Understanding
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, ensuring a systematic, data-driven approach. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to create informative charts and heatmaps for clearer data insig## Business Understanding The company is planning to enter the aviation sector by acquiring and operating aircraft for both commercial and private use. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the safety risks associated with different aircraft models. The key task is to identify low-risk aircraft and present these insights clearly to assist the management team in making informed purchasing decisions for the new aviation division.

## Problem Statement
The company faces significant challenges in selecting safe aircraft models due to a lack of comprehensive insights from historical incident data. Without a detailed analysis of past accidents, causes, and contributing factors, there is a real risk of acquiring aircraft that could lead to safety concerns, potentially endangering operations and reputation. This uncertainty compromises effective risk management and limits opportunities for safety improvements. To make informed, strategic decisions and safeguard operational safety, the company must identify the safest aircraft options and implement proactive strategies to mitigate potential risks.

## Data Understanding and Analysis
Data The dataset I,m are using for this project is drawn from kaggle.com gotteen from National Transportation Safety Board. The aviation accident database provides information on civil aviation accidents and select incidents dating back to 1962 to 2023 encompassing the United States, its territories, and international waters.

## Key Objctives:
* Identify Low-Risk Aircraft: Determine which aircraft models have the lowest incident rates and severity.
* Analyze Incident Trends: Study the evolution of aviation incidents over time to identify patterns.
* Assess Flight Phase Risks: Analyze which flight phases, such as takeoff cruise, are associated with higher risks.
* Examine Weather Impact: Explore the role of weather conditions in the occurrence and severity of njuries rates

### KeyLibraries:
* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* matplotlib: For data visualization.
* seaborn: Beautifies the visualizations.
* numpy For numerical computation

#### Conclusion:
* Focus on High-Risk Flight Phases: Enhance safety protocols and pilot training during these stages to reduce risks.

* Prioritize Aircraft with Multiple Engines: Aircraft with two or four engines show lower risk scores. Prioritize the acquisition of these types to improve fleet safety.

* Adopt Safer Engine Types: Reciprocating and electric engine aircraft have lower risk profiles. Consider expanding the fleet with these safer engine types.

* Pilot Vigilance in Good Weather: Most accidents occur in good weather (VMC) due to potential pilot complacency. Implement additional training to maintain vigilance in ideal weather conditions.

* Consider Low-Risk Aircraft Models: Cessna, Piper, and Rockwell, particularly the Cessna 172M, show the lowest risk scores. These models should be considered for fleet expansion based on their safety record. .

Rockwell, particularly the Cessna 172M, show the lowest risk scores. These models should be considered for fleet expansion based on their safety record.
